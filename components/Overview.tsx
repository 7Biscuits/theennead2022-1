            The Security Council has primary responsibility for the
            maintenance of international peace and security. It has 15
            Members, and each Member has one vote. Under the Charter of the
            United Nations, all Member States are obligated to comply with
            Council decisions. The Security Council takes the lead in
            determining the existence of a threat to the peace or act of
            aggression. It calls upon the parties to a dispute to settle it by
            peaceful means and recommends methods of adjustment or terms of
            settlement. In some cases, the Security Council can resort to
            imposing sanctions or even authorise the use of force to maintain
            or restore international peace and security

            The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is one of the 6 principal
            organs of the United Nations System established by the UN Charter
            in 1945. It consists of 54 Members of the United Nations elected
            by the General Assembly. ECOSOC coordinates economic, social, and
            related work of the fourteen United Nations specialised agencies,
            functional commissions and five regional commissions. It serves as
            the central forum for discussing international economic and social
            issues, and for formulating policy recommendations addressed to
            Member States and the United Nations system. It is responsible
            for: promoting higher standards of living, full employment, and
            economic and social progress; identifying solutions to
            international economic, social and health problems; facilitating
            international cultural and educational cooperation; and
            encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental

            academics, business sector representatives and more than 3,200
            registered non-governmental organisations. The work of the Council
            is conducted through several sessions and preparatory meetings,
            round tables and panel discussions with members of civil society
            throughout the year, to deal with the organisation of its work.
            Once a year, it meets for a four-week substantive session in July,
            alternating between New York and Geneva. The annual session is
            organised in five segments which include: the High-level segment;
            the Coordination segment; the Operational Activities segment; the
            Humanitarian Affairs segment; the General Segment.

          The WHO's mandate seeks and includes: working worldwide to promote health, keeping the world safe, and serving the vulnerable. It advocates that a billion more people should have: universal health care coverage, engagement with the monitoring of public health risks, coordinating responses to health emergencies, and promoting health and well-being. It provides technical assistance to countries, sets international health standards, and collects data on global health issues. A publication, the World Health Report, provides assessments of worldwide health topics. The WHO also serves as a forum for discussions of health issues.

The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse.
 Its World Health Assembly, the agency's decision-making body, elects and advises an executive board made up of 34 health specialists. It selects the director-general, sets goals and priorities, and approves the budget and activities.
